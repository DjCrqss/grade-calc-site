# Grade Calculator Website
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4.

This is my project I have created while in the process of teaching myself how to use Angular to create progressive web apps.
Users can add schooling years, semesters and courses on the main screen. Then you can rename them simply by clicking on the title.

Just click on a course to enter where you can set your grade goal, and start adding grade entries to calculate you final score!

## Upcoming features
- Adding all your tests and assignments for the year + a grade goal will 'fill' the ones you haven't done yet to show what you must achieve to stay on track.
- Selecting predict on a test/assignment will allow you to enter a predicted grade that will scale the unfilled ones as well if you're confident on what you will get!
- Filler images for the home screen and course screen if you have no added elements
- Possibly minimising cards 
- Make term/semester cards stored to scroll horizontally for less clutter and to be more in-line with material guidelines 


---------

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
